<p>A mysterious Etruscan <strong>artifact</strong> – a large, oval-shaped ceramic vessel with intricate carvings – was <strong>discovered</strong> in central Italy and has sparked debate among archaeologists regarding its <strong>purpose</strong>. The artifact is believed to date back to the 4th century BCE, while archaeologists have proposed three main theories regarding its purpose.</p>
<p>One theory is that the vessel was <strong>used in religious ceremonies</strong>. The carvings on the vessel depict scenes of offerings and deities, suggesting its role in sacred rituals. In the 4th century BCE, it was popular to <strong>slaughter</strong> sheep and chicken at large religious festivals in order to <strong>sacrifice</strong> them to the gods. The locals believed that sacrificing animals would <strong>gain the trust and blessing of the gods</strong>. Thus, the carvings on the pottery might <strong>reflect such scenes</strong> and it may have been a <strong>container for animal sacrifices</strong>.</p>
<p>Another theory is that the vessel was used to <strong>store food or drink</strong>. According to <strong>historical records and findings at excavation sites</strong>, ancient people in central Italy occasionally stored wheat and wine in large earthenware vessels and buried them in the ground in order to preserve them. The vessel’s <strong>large size and sturdy construction</strong> make it an ideal container for holding substantial quantities of food or drink, thus indicating the possibility of a container for utilitarian purposes.</p>
<p>A third theory suggests that the vessel was a <strong>funerary object</strong>. Actually, vessels <strong>similar</strong> in shape and size have been <strong>found</strong> in three burial sites near the land of excavation. In particular, the <strong>intricate carvings</strong> on the vessel are highly decorative, which could <strong>represent a form of homage</strong> to the deceased, or a way to <strong>highlight the social status</strong> of the deceased, such as a member of a royal family or a religious leader.</p>

<p>While all these theories about the actual purpose of this ceramic vessel are thought-provoking, each has its <strong>flaws</strong> that need to be considered, and <strong>none can be definitively proven without more concrete evidence</strong>.</p>
<p>First, the idea that the vessel was a “ritual vessel” is questionable. The carvings, though depicting deities, do not necessarily imply a religious function. Such scenes were <strong>common in everyday items</strong> and could reflect cultural narratives rather than ritualistic use. Actually, this way of decoration is <strong>still common today</strong> – many of the daily items we use, say vases, teapots, and coffee mugs, a lot of times come with depictions of historical or mythical characters and events.</p>
<p>Second, the theory of it being a “storage container” is not entirely convincing. The vessel’s size and construction, combined with historical records, might suggest a storage purpose for food and drink, but its <strong>intricate carvings would be impractical</strong> for a container meant for everyday use in the 4th century BCE. The sophisticated carvings were certainly handmade with great effort, which made it unlikely for mundane purposes like storage. In addition, the vessel was <strong>discovered in almost pristine condition</strong> and did not show the wear and tear of daily handling.</p>
<p>Lastly, the “funerary object” hypothesis also has weaknesses. Although three excavation sites have yielded similar pottery, this <strong>number is too small to prove</strong> the widespread use of such pottery as funerary objects by the local people. Actually, recent excavations have discovered that funerary objects of that time in that part of central Italy were <strong>almost all stone tools</strong>. It is possible that people of that time preferred funerary objects of practical purposes over symbolic values.</p>

<p>From my perspective, social media companies should regulate their platforms themselves rather than governments since it is the most effective way to build up tailored regulation systems.</p>
<p>To be more specific, social media companies are familiar with the environment of the platforms and have a better understanding of which areas may present potential issues. Therefore, when it comes to bad content from the users, these companies could react on it quickly, minimizing the negative impact.</p>
<p>For example, social media companies like Reddit have dedicated departments to monitor different parts of platforms real-time, which enables the rules to be obeyed meticulously. Moreover, these companies can analyze such negative user behaviors and then refine their regulation systems, creating tailored approaches.</p>
<p>Still, some might claim that allowing the companies to manage themselves lacks fairness, as different companies may set varying standards. However, governments can provide broad guidelines to ensure that these platforms align with public interests, while also allow businesses some flexibility to implement specific measures based on their unique platforms and users.</p>

<li>I believe grading shall focus on students’ performance on assignments and tests, <strong>since</strong> it is the most effective way to measure the progress in their study. (27)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>I believe effort is important because experience is good.</p>
<ul>
<li>In my opinion, effort is an important element to be considered in study and grading <strong>due to the fact that</strong> students learn from both what they have done right and what they have done wrong. (31)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="elaboration-template">Elaboration Template</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>To be more specific</strong>, during a discussion, students not only have to come up with their own thoughts but also consider those from others, which stimulates an active way of thinking.</li>
<li><strong>To elaborate</strong>, practical experience will help students witness the true nature of a job instead of developing some random imagination based on their limited experience, developing a real passion in their field of study.</li>
<li><strong>In other words</strong>, it is only in a prosperous, stable, and developed society that we can allocate extra resources to implement the protection of the environment.</li>
<li><strong>More specifically</strong>, instead of thinking and analyzing a problem, people might rely on technology to search for quick answers to every question they have in life and study.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how-to-elaborate">How to Elaborate</h4>
<ul>
<li>I believe effort is important because experience is good. As far as I am concerned, the fact that students learn from both good and bad results in study indicates that effort is an important element to be considered in study and grading. (33)
<ul>
<li>To elaborate, students not only gain academic knowledge from a correct understanding of class materials, but also obtain a stronger resilience and judgment power through their mistakes, developing both technical and life skills. (35)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="more-examples">More Examples</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do you think ongoing job training is the most important investment a business can make?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It is certain that</strong> ongoing job training is an essential part of business <strong>because</strong> it helps employees to stay competitive in today’s rapidly changing world. (27)<br>
<strong>To be more specific</strong>, instead of relying on outdated skillsets, ongoing job training not only provides employees an insight into advanced strategies but also equip them with competitive technical skills, <strong>which</strong> in turn helps the company to keep vibrant. (39)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the biggest mistake that people make when it comes to purchase of tech products?</p>
<ul>
<li>The biggest mistake in the purchase of tech products is that consumers almost always pay for what they do not need <strong>since</strong> people are easily misled by advertisements. (28)<br>
To elaborate, TV and internet commercials usually illustrate the most sophisticated and powerful functions of high-tech products in an exaggerated manner, <strong>which</strong> are unfortunately rarely needed. (26)</li>

<p>To be more specific, performance on assignments and tests best reflect students’ understanding of academic concepts and their problem-solving skills, which are also the objective of most courses. (29)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For example</strong>, the score on a mathematics test indicates if the student has completely understood formulas and theories, and if they can apply them in various conditions. (27)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Electronic devices help students on their study.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For example</strong>, students can find different ways of thinking for whatever questions they have with their mobile phones wherever they are, greatly broadening their mind. (25)</li>

<li>For instance, last week, my little niece had a homework <strong>from her biology class about animal behaviors</strong>. <strong>Instead of relying on limited knowledge on books</strong>, she used her mobile phone to search for diverse information on the internet, <strong>including why and how animals play, which earned her a good grade for the excellent work</strong>.

<li><strong>The biggest mistake in the purchase of tech products is that</strong> consumers almost always pay for what they do not need <strong>since</strong> people are easily misled by advertisements. (28) <strong>To elaborate</strong>, TV and internet commercials usually illustrate the most sophisticated and powerful functions of high-tech products in an exaggerated manner, <strong>which</strong> are unfortunately rarely needed. (26)</li>
<li><strong>For example</strong>, commercials may demonstrate how a powerful laptop may solve all problems in our work and life, while we end up just using the expensive laptop with basic jobs such as editing texts and PowerPoint slides. (37)</li>

<li>Do you think ongoing job training is the most important investment a business can make?</li>
<li>I don’t think so. Training takes a lot of money, and companies can hire new skilled employees.
<ul>
<li>Still, a voice arises that businesses can save money from training by recruiting new employees.<br>
Ironically, even the most talented and skilled new employees will need time and training to best adapt themselves to a new environment, which is a lot of times more expensive than ongoing job training. (15+34)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the biggest mistake that people make when it comes to the purchase of tech products?</li>
<li>They often don’t consider the compatibility of software. The software we are used to might not work on the new device. It can be troublesome to learn new software.
<ul>
<li>Nevertheless, some state that the biggest mistake is that the software we are familiar with might not be compatible with the new tech products. However, with the development of computer science, software today can usually be used on multiple platforms. For example, PowerPoint can be used on both PC and Mac, and even on mobile devices.
